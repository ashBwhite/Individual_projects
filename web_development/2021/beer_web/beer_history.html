        <h2 class="content3">What is beer?</h2>
        <p class="body_content">Beer is an alcoholic beverage made by the mixture of grain and yeast and fermented. Grains used to make beer are barley, wheat, rye, corn or rice. Alcohol range of beer is from 2% to 15%.</p>
        <h2 class="content3">Different Methods of Brewing Beer</h2>
        <h4 class="content4">Extract Brewing</h4>
        <p class="body_content">This brewing method uses extracts from the grains either in dried or liquid form or even a mixture of both.<br>This method uses small quantities of grain to add depth to the beer, however this method has a short process and less equipment to brew the beer.<br>This method is mostly welcomed by home-brewers.</p>
        <h4 class="content4">Partial Mash</h4>
        <p class="body_content">This process involves the use of malt extract as grain. Mixing the use of malt and grain gives a chance to have better overall quality.<br>At the same time, it does not require much more time or equipment compared to extract brewing methods.
        </p>
        <h4 class="content4">Whole Grain Brewing</h4>
        <p class="body_content">This is a traditional method to make beer. However, this method requires a lot more time and equipment to process.<br>This method also does not use any malt extracts like other two methods do.<br>This method is recommended for people who are experienced and understand the whole process of brewing beer.

        <h2 class="content3">Steps to Brew a Beer - Homemade Version</h2>
        <h4 class="content4">Milling the Grain and Mash Conversing</h4>
        <p class="body_content">The first step is crushing multiple types of malt to break up the grain kernels. Malt is cereal grain that has been soaked in water and then dried with hot air. Breaking up the malt allows us to extract the fermentable sugar. This product is known as grist and is put into a mash tun. A mash tun is a container similar to a kettle as it retains heat. The mash tun has removable plates as the base allowing it to control cooling within. The grist is mixed with hot water and breaks down the starch into sugars.
        </p>
        <h4 class="content4">Lautering and Boiling</h4>
        <p class="body_content">The mash is then pumped into a lauter tun which is a special machine that separates the wort from the grain husks. Wort is a sweet liquid and once separated from the grain husks is pumped into the kettle. The kettle brings the wort to a controlled boiling point. Once reached hops are put into the add flavour and stability to the beer.
        </p>
        <h4 class="content4">Wort Separation and Fermentation</h4>
        <p class="body_content">After boiling the wort is transferred into a whirlpool for wort separation. Into this stage any leftover hops or malts are removed leaving a liquid ready for fermentation. The wort is cooled as fast as possible as the longer it sits without being mixed with yeast the higher chance of contamination. To start fermentation yeast is added to the vessel in order to convert the wort. The wort when mixed with yeast produces alcohol, carbon dioxide and gives the beer its flavour. If you are creating an ale beer is left for two weeks at 68 F and if you are creating a lager it will remain for 6 weeks at 48 F. When fermentation is almost complete the yeast will start to gather at the base of the vessel where it can be extracted and reused for the next batch of beer. Yeast can be reused multiple times but must be inspected after each use to confirm it hasn’t mutated as that would severely affect taste.</p>
        <h4 class="content4">Bottling and Kegging</h4>
        <p class="body_content">Bottle and kegging is extremely important as it keeps the beer from contamination. By keeping stray yeasts and oxygen away from the beer helps maintain the it’s shelf life and taste. Empty bottles are loaded into a line and is rinsed with a chlorine solution. It is then blasted with Carbon dioxide multiple times to remove the chlorine. The beer is poured in while also being blasted with more carbon dioxide in order to stop the beer from foaming up within the bottle. Before capping the last bit of air needs to be purged and this is done by blasting it with a quick stream of water to make it foam up. The excess beer is wiped off and the beer is then capped. Kegs are filled in a similar manner with one tube to pour in beer and one tube to pressurize the keg with carbon dioxide. With all that done the process is all done and your beer is ready to be drunk.
